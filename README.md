## Merge and Quick Sort Implementations
This is a repository that contains my second assignment for MSCS532. This is a Python implementation of the Merge Sort and Quick Sort algorithms. The algorithm was utilized to sort a list of numbers using the divide and conquer paradigm.

## Project Overview


## Deliverables:
``` MergeSort.py ``` - Python file containing the function merge_sort, merge, test_case_run and example use cases to merge sort sorted data, reverse sorted data, and random sorted data. 
``` QuickSort.py ``` - Python file containing the function quick_sort, quick, test_case_run and example use cases to quick sort sorted data, reverse sorted data, and random sorted data. 

How to Run:
- Save the Python file.
- Open terminal or preferred IDE
- Navigate and open the saved file
- Run the script using your Python interpreter.
